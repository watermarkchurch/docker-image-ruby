# Watermark Ruby Docker Image

This is Watermark's base image for all Ruby applications. It installs
Ruby using the ruby-build library into `/usr/local`. The oldest
supported Ruby is the 2.1 branch. You can use the `2.1` tag to get the
latest Ruby from the 2.1 branch or `latest` will always give you the
latest Ruby available.
